# Companies in the FinTech Field, Case Study

## Background

With the development of several enabling technologies such as:

   * Software Development Tools
   * Blockchain technology
   * Smart Contracts
   * Robotics
   * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
   * Communication throughput and coverage

The fields of Technology and Finances experienced a revolution in the way the individual processes are performed. This revolution has given raised to the new field combining all these technological advances call FinTech. And these synergies have also accelerated the changes in each of the original fields[^1].

Academically, several domains have been identified the field of FinTech such as:

    1. Capital Market:
        * Capital Investment
        * Investment Management
        * Insurance (InsurTech)
        * Mortgage/Real Estate
        
    2. Digital Banking 
        * Payments/Billing
        * Lending
        * Open Banking
        * Regulation Technology (RegTech)
        * B2B and P2P
        * Decentralized Banking
        * Virtual representation of financial Instruments or Products
        
    3. Consumer Finances
        * Personal Finances and Budgeting
        * Wealth Management
        * Robo-advising

        * Smart Contracts and Chainlink Solution
        * Risk analysis
        * Enterprise Solutions
        * Fraud Protection

Companies have evolved or gotten into the implementation of solutions to address the challenges in each of these domains. Some companies focusing on one area while others working on several domains. 

My goal for this bootcamp is to be able to work for one of the enabling companies creating blockchain solution or distributed financial applications.

The number of companies doing this type of development is huge. There are a lot of companies doing internal development to address these developments like the big banks, JPMorgan and Citi also the transaction processors are doing the same as MasterCard, Visa, PayPal and Block. At the same time there are a lot of smaller companies and startups also getting into this development[^5].

Even or because all these companies working on fintech technology, there is a long way to go to have a stable infrastructure, a common protocol and stablish programming style and even language stable language to implement the programming needed to implement all the support infrastructure for FinTech. The fact that you have big traditional companies doing internal development does not help in the advancement of a stable framework and standards[^6].

But the FinTech field and its enabling technologies will continue evolving towards a stable, uniform, and compatible stage.

I would like to be part of this process in the software and blockchain infrastructure working with a medium size company that is facilitating solution to other companies, be them startup or large well stablished corporations. Among these companies you could list the following:

    * Coinbase
    * MicroStrategy
    * Paypal
    * Addepar Resources
    * Relevant
    * Innowise
    * Hedgeable
    * Chime

From these companies, **Addepar** call my attention for the project they are developing at the present time.

## Overview and Origin

**Addepar** was founded and incorporated in 2009 and has its headquarters in Mountain View, California. To this moment, it has opened offices in other cities in the United State as well as in the United Kingdom and in India. In term of employees, it is small with only 800 total employees. As of 2022, the company has a valuation of $2.17 billion. As a startup, it received funding from venture capital institution like Formation 8, Anduin Ventures, 8VC, D1 Capital Partners, WestCap Group among others.[^1][^3]

One of its founders, Joe Lonsdale, was also a founder of Palantir Technologies, a big data analytics company. But in 2009 he separated from Palantir and with Jason Mirra started **Addepar**, trying to expand in other areas of the FinTech domain [^2].

In its website, **Addepar** states as its objective to be “an open architecture, multi-product tech and data platform that delivers wealth managers rich data aggregation with maximum flexibility and scalability so that you can do what you do best - even better”. This is focused on a clientele of RIA, Registered Investment Advisors.[^6]

## Technology and Tools

To archive this goal, they have been taking advantage of some of the FinTech technology developing in recent time. They use the AWS cloud services as data storage and elastic scalability. For the data analysis in the backend, they use _Java_ and _Python_ packages. They have incorporated into their system HashiCorp’s _Vault infrastructure_ that provide critical secure configuration settings.

The front-end is built mainly using _JavaScript_ and _CSS_ by using the Ember framework. This framework also encapsulates the data connection to the back-end, making it easy to modify and enhance. 

The focus of the problem is that in the financial advice, particularly for fiduciary advisors, speed, clarity and foresight are a necessity. The traditional tools, like excel and traditional reporting tools are not good enough in analyzing data from different data sources and presenting trends and insight into the futures considering current events around the world. So, the expectations of the customers are rising, and this demand is genuine, trying to be more personal in their interaction with their own clientele.[^4] 

To address this demand, **Addepar** has been developing a platform that can handle this demand aggregating all financial accounts and investments, enhance it with relevant market and third-party data to provide a consolidated view of the RIA’s clients wealth across institutions.
**Addepar** has a niche market business model, with a specialized customer segment. The company targets its offerings to wealth advisors, private banks, large financial institutions, wirehouse teams, funds, and fund administrators.

Its value proposition is based mainly on three pillars: convenience, performance, and brand/status.

Using their software, the company provide a simplified portfolio analysis, but at the same time in a very comprehensive accurate picture, allowing clientele to better understand the interplay of various assets and how day to day events impact the portfolio. The company has demonstrated strong performance through tangible results for clients[^7]. Their software makes use of extensive data mining and AI to gather data from different sources to create this analysis.

Their customers like **Addepar** proposition since most are RIA’s and need more information than just data tables and charts. They need more comprehensive analysis of the complete set of assets and information about outside events that might affect those assets to be able to tell a story about what customer need to do looking into the future.

**Addepar** platform has the flexibility to have out-of-the-box report templates as well as creating custom content according to the RIA customer demands. 

Privacy is a very important and delicate aspect of handling all this personal data and for security consciousness is a fundamental component of their operational excellence. 

The company has also developed an API to make their services available to other companies that want a more customized solution. Along with the API they already have developed a good documentation and on-boarding procedures to facilitate this offering.

Moving forward, they are looking to integrate technology like _Apache Spark_, _Arrow_, and _Storm_ to take advantage of distribution of storage and higher capacity execution frameworks.

## Results

The company has had so much success among its main customer base that even Morgan Stanley contracted **Addepar** to provide 20 of its top financial advisors’ team to help them with their wealthiest clients’ assets [^8]. 

Through 2022, the company has reached the management of $3.5 trillion in client assets, they have reached 1.5M custody accounts, they help their clients with time efficiency achieving a 50% reduction in time to produce reports. And 25% of their RIA clients outgrow their peers. 

They recently announced a deeper integration with **Schwab** and a partnership with **Salesforce** to connect to their financial Services Cloud.

## Recommendations

The company is growing fast in quantity of clients and amount of assets under management. This is a good reason for **Addepar** to start getting more into the Web 3.0 environment. This implies start implementing start contracts to increase the security, transparency and availability of customer information and contracts. This also would create an additional service of providing cryptography to their clientele by extending the API that they already have. Moving the Web 3.0 would expand the amount and type of clientele, create additional income streams and would put **Addepar** even more in the leadership position of financial services.
